# Architecture Overview

This documentation is based on a simplified version of the [arc42 template](https://arc42.org/).

For the diagrams, the [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) tool has been used. If you wish to view the
diagrams in your IDE's Markdown preview, you will need to install the corresponding plugin.
